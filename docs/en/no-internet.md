# VPN Connects but There Is No Internet

The connect button turned green, so the server is reachable and the tunnel is up — that is already half the battle. What is left is figuring out where the traffic goes inside the tunnel. Work through the points in order: the cause is usually in the first two.

## 1. Two VPNs at once {#two-vpns}

If a second VPN client is installed on the device (even inactive) or a system profile from another service remains, it can hijack the routes. Disable and remove the extra VPN profiles, then reconnect.

## 2. Antivirus and blockers {#security-software}

Antivirus suites, firewalls, and ad blockers (AdGuard and similar) often filter traffic at the system level and conflict with the VPN client. Turn them off while testing.

## 3. Blocking rules on the server {#server-rules}

If you configured the server through the 3X-UI panel and enabled blocking for the `.ru`, `.su`, `.рф` zones or the `RU Russia` list, Russian sites will not open through the VPN — that is the rules working as intended. Review the list in **Xray Configs → Basic Routing**: **[Blocking ads and RU domains](/en/3x-ui#routing)**.

## 4. Outdated client or broken configuration {#reinstall-protocol}

Update the AmneziaVPN app to the latest version, delete the protocol in the server settings, and install it again. Keys issued before the protocol was reinstalled stop working — hand out new ones.

## 5. The service itself rejects data-center traffic {#service-blocks}

If only a specific service fails rather than everything, its own filters may be the cause: **[Gemini](/en/gemini)**, for example, rejects requests from hosting addresses. Check whether other sites open.
